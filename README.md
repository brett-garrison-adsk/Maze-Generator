# Maze Generator
Created from FormIt Plugin Playground

Create a maze inside FormIt!

Credit goes to Daniel Shiffman at http://codingtra.in for [demonstrating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4) the [recursive backtracking method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_implementation) using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The 1st iteration of the generator algorithm can be seen in operation [here](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/EBkm4txSA). To render the walls, the lines needed to be given width. The p5.js operation of this can be seen [here](https://editor.p5js.org/garrisb82/sketches/ScbmtYvPa). Finally, the p5js line calls needed to be converted to FormIt JS API calls.
